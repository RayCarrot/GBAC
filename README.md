# GBAC - GBA Compressed Data Finder
GBAC is a tool for easily finding compressed data in a GBA ROM. It allows searching the file for compressed data and visualizing the data as a palette, tiles and map. It can also be used to replace replaced data by importing it.

Currently importing Huffman compressed data is not support.
